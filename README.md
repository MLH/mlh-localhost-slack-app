Welcome to MLH Localhost: Build Apps for Slack! 
=================

Click `Show` in the header to run your app. 

Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

This file contains information about all the other files in this project! 

### ← index.html

This is just a placeholder file because you'll be interacting with this app in a Slack workspace instead of through your browser! 

### ← game.js

This file manages the logic of the game. 

### ← index.js

This file handles the requests and responses of our app. 

### ← .env

The file where you'll need to put your environment variables. This is called a dot file (because of the period before env) and no one will be able to see what you put in this file. You'll need to put some values from the Slack API here. 

### ← package.json

This file contains a list of dependencies that your app requires to run. Lucky for you, Glitch will install them automatically for you! 

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.
